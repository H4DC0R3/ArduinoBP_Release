# ArduinoBP

ArduinoBP is a visual tool that lets you build Arduino code using a node-based system, kind of like Unreal Engine's Blueprints. Instead of writing code manually, you drag and connect nodes, and the C++ code is generated for you‚Äîready to copy and paste into the Arduino IDE.

## What is this?

ArduinoBP was built to make Arduino development easier and more fun, especially for people who like to think visually. It supports everything from basic math and logic to sensors, MP3 playback, TFT displays, and more. You can even build your own custom libraries and extend the system however you want.

This project runs on top of LiteGraph.js and adds a ton of features.

## How does it work?

1. You start by placing a `Setup` and `Loop` node.
2. Then you drag in other nodes like `Print`, `If`, `Add`, or sensor readers.
3. Connect them to define the logic visually.
4. Click "Generate Code" and it will spit out clean, ready-to-run C++ code.

## Example Projects

I'll be adding photos and videos soon to show some examples. If you want to contribute your own, feel free to share them with me!

## Node Highlights

Here are some node types you‚Äôll find:

- **Flow Control:** Branch, DoOnce, ForLoop, While, Gate, FlipFlop, MultiGate
- **Math:** Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulo (for Int, Float, Byte, and more)
- **Logic:** Equal, Not Equal, Greater, Less, etc.
- **Variables:** Int, Float, Bool, Byte, String, Color, Vector3 ‚Äì including arrays (WIP)
- **Debugging:** Print, PrintCleanString (replaces line in Serial Monitor)
- **Sensors:** VL53L0X, MPU6050, MPU9250, MPU9262, and more (Any request to sensors you can ask on Discord, and follow actual request on Trello)

## Community

If you're working on a project, stuck on something, or just want to talk ideas, come hang out on Discord. We‚Äôre building a small but helpful community.

This is still a work-in-progress and growing every day. If you want to contribute, test, or just chat, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

## üìö Documentation

Here you will find a collection of tutorials, usage examples, and guides to help you get the most out of **ArduinoBP**.

### üîß Getting Started

**Description:**  
You will still need the Arduino IDE to compile the code. ArduinoBP includes a tool to export `.ino` files.  
Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries corresponding to the `#include` statements in your code, just like you normally would when coding manually.
